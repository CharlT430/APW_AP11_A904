    <h2>The Layers of Networking</h2>
    <p>Before we delve deeper into Layer 8, let's briefly recap the traditional seven-layer OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model, which serves as the foundation for understanding networking protocols and their interactions:</p>
    <ol>
        <li class="a"> <b>Layer 1 (Physical): </b>Deals with the physical connection and transmission of data, such as cables and switches.</li>
        <li class="b"> <b>Layer 2 (Data Link):</b>Responsible for data framing and error detection, typically involving MAC addresses.</li>
        <li class="a"><b>Layer 3 (Network): </b>Manages logical addressing and routing, with IP addresses being a key component.</li>
        <li class="b"> <b>Layer 4 (Transport): </b> Focuses on end-to-end communication and error recovery, exemplified by TCP and UDP.</li>
        <li class="a"> <b>Layer 5 (Session): </b> Facilitates communication establishment and termination.</li>
        <li class="b"><b>Layer 6 (Presentation):</b> Concerned with data translation and encryption/decryption</li>
        <li class="a"><b>Layer 7 (Application): </b>The user interface and application layer where software interacts directly with the user.</li>
    </ol>
