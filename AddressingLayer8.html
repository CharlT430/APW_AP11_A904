        <h2>Addressing Layer 8 Issues</h2>
        <p>To manage Layer 8 issues effectively, organizations must adopt a holistic approach that combines technology and human-focused strategies:</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="a"> <b>Education and Training:  </b> Regular training on cybersecurity best practices, company policies, and technology updates is essential to raise awareness and reduce security-related issues.</li>
            <li class="b"> <b>Clear Communication: </b>Open and transparent communication between IT teams and end-users can help identify and address issues early, promoting a culture of collaboration.</li>
            <li class="a"><b>User-Centric Design:   </b>When developing software and systems, consider the end-users' needs, preferences, and abilities. User-friendly interfaces and intuitive designs can reduce user errors.</li>
            <li class="b"> <b>Policy Enforcement:  </b>Clearly defined policies and procedures should be consistently enforced, with consequences for non-compliance clearly communicated.</li>
            <li class="a"> <b>Change Management:  </b>Clearly defined policies and procedures should be consistently enforced, with consequences for non-compliance clearly communicated.</li>
            <li class="b"> <b>Monitoring and Reporting:  </b>Implement monitoring systems to track user behavior and identify potential issues before they become major problems.</li>
